<p>Finally, the cat was I recently raised.He was mischievous and liked to fight with his brother and sister.When I wanted to punish him, he was good at

<p>But sometimes，The biggest brother and sister also like to fight.</p>
<br>
My  three cats from the store to buy is not I don't want to adopt.I think, regardless of adoption or purchase, as long as you choose not to discard he, even to see he as the family ，that is a good way.
<br>
In the end，thanks your for watch.
